py_WPComment
============

a python script to manage comments on a WordPress powered website

Files

* *icons/* - directory containing the icon that shows up on the taskbar. Also used as the program icon
  |- *wpmini-grey.png* - this is the icon :)

* *license.txt* - the complete text for the GNU Gpl v2

* *main.py* - the main program file

* *test.py* - here I've run some testes on the xml-rpc api by WordPress

I'm looking for help

I'm not very good at python but I want to learn, so if you think you can help me with the code you see here, please let me know, I'm waiting for you!
